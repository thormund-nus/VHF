# Spectrogram Recreation

This subfolder under Archive/ serves to recreate Miguel's UROPs' Figure 37.
We keep in mind that the figure in the report had been manipulated through MS
words.

Here, we recreate the figure from bin trc source, and utilise MatPlotLib to
generate the figure as suitable as is possible for the poster. This is mostly
done in traffic-spectrum.py

## Folder Structure
`Data/`:
  binary files (soft linked) which were used in Miguel's report.

`original_script/`:
  FFT-*.py files are either handtyped or email-copies of what Miguel had
  recalled off the top of his head. Parameters and code structure are not
  accurate, and only server as scaffold reference
  `older_obspy_version/`:
    Conda libraries as installed by Miguel, with zip files.
    Note that these are outdated version of many things.
    `python`: 3.10.9
    `conda`: ??
    `matplotlib`: 3.7.0
    `obspy`: 1.2.2
    Also contains reference screenshots generated by Matplotlib without MS Word
    modification.

`test/`:
  Unit tests to ensure 1-to-1 compatability between my rewritten code from
  Miguels' code

`transfer/`:
  Provides way to pack and unpack spectrogram relevant binary data into numpyz
  format.
