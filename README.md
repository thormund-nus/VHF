This folder is a collection of scripts intended for invoking and parsing the 
output of teststream.c executable, as provided from svn/usbhybrid (r14).

Please be very aware of the use of symlinks in this folder.

## Usage

Some of the following information below is outdated, as it has been made
slightly redundant with the makefile, and that `set_device_mode` has been moved
to `VHF/init_board/`, but the information still remains relevant for triage.

---
### Setup

`set_device_mode.cpp` is compiled by the GCC to become the executable
`set_device_mode`. For it to function properly, it is necessary that this
executable has the necessary permissions. Ideally, `ls -la` would show
```
  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root   users <size> <date> <time> set_device_mode
```

This can be done by `chown root` and `chmod u+x` on the file.

Currently, several files utilise symbolic links to the board and streaming
exec, namely, `/dev/usbhybrid0` and `~/programs/usbhybrid/apps/teststream`.

We note that the relevant locations to these may change in the future, and is
therefore the use of a symbolic link helps keep things self-contained.

The symbolic links currently are
```
  vhf_board.softlink -> /dev/usbhybrid0  
  teststream.exec -> ~/programs/usbhybrid/apps/teststream
```

clear_FIFO.py will prompt as to the symblinks locations.

### Red light is active

The VHF board has a red light used to indicate the FIFO being overflowed.
`clear_FIFO.py` has dependencies `set_device_mode`.

For the most part, this script is run to reset the VHF board into a state ready
for collecting 'stream' data.

### Collecting Data

`run_VHF.py` and `run_and_plot.py` are examples you can refer to. Do note that
they currently pull parameter information from `VHF_board_params.ini` to guide
the filename and locations.

### Plotting Data

Requirements.txt provides additional gui things that assists with plotting
process. However, the installed python modules have some build dependencies.
On OpenSUSE, consider
```
  zypper install cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel
```
prior to
```
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additional details:  
1. ISO datetime  
In the process of plotting data, git-svn-id: svn://usbhybrid@12 introduced
timing information of the command being recorded straight into the data header.
With string format specifier `%F %T %z`, it is not an ISO-8601 compliant
string, but Python 3.11 and 3.12's datetime library seems to accept it. Until
the svn usbhybrid repository solves this issue, a test as provided in
test/test_datetime.py is provisioned, in case.  
Without VSCode, the tests can be runned by navigating into the `test/` folder,
and running `pytest` in the command line. (This assumes that pip has already
installed pytest.)  
**This should be fixed in USBHybrid repository.**

## Synology NAS for Data collection

Majority of mounting details are documented on Confluence.

To check if it has been mounted, use `mount | grep nfs`. An example `/etc/fstab`:  
```
/etc/fstab

192.168.109.131:/volume1/fibre_sensing	/mnt/nas-fibre-sensing	nfs defaults,_netdev,timeo=900,retrans=5,sec=sys,vers=4,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.mount-timeout=15,x-systemd.idle-timeout=10min,nofail 0 0
```
